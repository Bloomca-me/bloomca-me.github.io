    Hi! My name is Seva, and I am a web developer for about ~<script>
      var now = new Date();
      document.write(now.getFullYear() - 2013);
    </script> years.
    I am a fullstack web developer, working mostly on the frontend, architecturing and evolving big applications. On the backend I mostly write small services, APIs, or just some utility scripts using Node.js.

    I am from Russia originally, from the Arctic ocean shore, and now live in Florence, Oregon, USA. Before I had been living in Berlin, Germany, then in Prague, Czech Republic, and in Serbia (mostly in Novi Sad). I love to travel around, especially in not so famous parts around me, and occasionally I take pictures â€“ however, my beloved wife does it levels above me, feel free to take a look <a href="https://jess.gallery/">at her website</a>:
