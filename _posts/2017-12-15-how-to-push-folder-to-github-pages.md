Github pages allow you to host your static applications from their CDN. This is a nice and very convenient way to serve documentation, example application, or just some parts of your code. However, it requires you to have a separate branch `gh-pages`, where you need to put `index.html` to the top level (so, no nested directories). Manual approach to this is pretty annoying, and here I would like to share an easy way to upload new versions in one command. There are other ways (for example, [using subtree](https://gist.github.com/cobyism/4730490)), of course, I just find this one easier, since I have to add only one command for deployment.

## Always create the branch from scratch

In a nutshell, the solution is to create a new branch from scratch every time, commit files as a first commit, and then rewrite remote branch with `--force` flag.

Let's assume you have a `dist` folder, which is generated by building your application, and it is ignored in your `.gitignore` file. Let's assume `npm run build` builds your application, feel free to replace to your command.

> We remove the whole `dist` folder. It is not necessary, but in our case we need at least to remove `dist/.git` folder, so we don't deal with updates

{% highlight sh linenos=table %}
# First, we need to remove old `dist` folder
rm -rf dist

# Build new `dist` folder
npm run build
{% endhighlight %}

Now we need to create a new git repository in this folder and commit all files. This will be the first and the last commit in our deployment branch:

{% highlight sh linenos=table %}
# go to the build directory
cd dist

# create new git repository
git init

# stage everything
git add .

# add our single commit
git commit -m "Initial commit"
{% endhighlight %}

The last step is to add remote to our git repo and push it to needed page. I'd use remote from my [equalizer application](https://github.com/Bloomca/equalizer), and `gh-pages` as a deployment branch:

{% highlight sh linenos=table %}
# add remote origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:Bloomca/equalizer.git

# push to the remote gh-pages branch with force
git push --force origin master:gh-pages
{% endhighlight %}

That's it! Now, the single thing we need to do – unite all of it into one command and add it as an option in our [scripts in package.json](https://www.keithcirkel.co.uk/how-to-use-npm-as-a-build-tool/). So, we need to connect all of them into one command and add it to your list (in my case, it is `package.json`):

{% highlight sh linenos=table %}
rm -rf dist && npm run build && \
cd dist && git init && git add . \
&& git commit -m "Initial commit" && \
git remote add origin git@github.com:Bloomca/equalizer.git && \
git push --force origin master:gh-pages
{% endhighlight %}

And now we are done! I can use just `npm run deploy` and the latest version will be on gh-pages almost immediately.
